# Maximum Diff of Circual Adjusts

Given a circular array nums, find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.

> Note: In a circular array, the first and last elements are adjacent.

## Example

```
Input: nums = [1,2,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Because nums is circular, nums[0] and nums[2] are adjacent. They have the maximum absolute difference of |4 - 1| = 3.
```
